# Phase II: Design Report for Team K: App: TeamUp
 
#### This report is meant to provide the data structure and logic to
carry out the functionalities dictated by the specification. Keep
in mind the implementation will be entirely based on this document,
adequate details should thus be given at length.

 ### 1. Introduction
 an overall picture of the system using collaboration class diagram

### 3. E-R diagram for the entire system attributes and key for each class should be provided

### 4. Detailed design:
    for EVERY method use pseudo-code to delineate the input/output and
    main functionalities
    
### 5. System screens:
    demonstrate major GUI screens of the system and a prototype of one
    functionality of your own choice.
### 6. Minutes of group meetings and possible concerns of team work

 ### 7. Address of the git repo (github, gitlab, bitbucket, etc) of your 
    team's work so far - put all materials including this report there
    Git repo and such is all here.
